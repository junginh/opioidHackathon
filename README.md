## Our solution
Use tweets, 7 economical features, 8 possible targets \
Provide prediction model using Scikit-learn library\

### Data preprocessing 
*Data is security sensitive and is provided from Professor _____ at UCI.* \
Randomly select 10,000 tweets in U.S. area \


In future application: the tweets can be updated and fed into the algorithm to strenghten \
